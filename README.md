		STRNG --- Sonic Transmission Random Number Generator

#Introduction

STRNG (IPA: /strɔŋ/) is a proof-of-concept/self-imposed challenge which uses short, dynamically recorded soundbites to generate strings of random numbers. The idea is to use the unpredictability of real-world noise to add chaos into number generation.

The length and method of generation can be altered as necessary, either directly by passing options into the STRNG function, or indirectly via the configuration of the audio recordings.
